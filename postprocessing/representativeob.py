"""A class that generates representative observations from a combination of adjacent stations.

We want to give multiple dataframes of different stations (stid), find way to reduce to one number
(this could be a mean, etc), and then create a new dataframe with the representative observations.

We would then give a "stid" like "Northern Wasatch Mtns" and "near lake" for the north valley, for instance
